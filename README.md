**DESIGN / GAMEPLAY**
</br></br>
Idea: </br>
A Galaga/Space Invaders style rogue-like. Players will control a character able to move side to side, and slightly up and down. Waves of enemies will come on screen shoot at the player. Player will shoot back while dodging incoming fire</br>
There will be bonuses to earn, power-ups to use, and items to buy.</br>
Players will fight through waves of enemies, with bosses every now and then, with the goal of beating a 'final' boss. Though, being a rogue-like, there should be tons of replay value.</br></br>
Genre : Arcade Style 'Shoot em Up' / Rogue-Like</br></br>
Style : TBD (Pixel Art - Old Arcade Aesthetic?)</br></br>

**ABOUT**</br></br>
This project is sort of a sidestep from my bigger project, Prismatic Depths.</br></br>
I wanted to create a smaller, simpler game so I could see the full process from start to finish, as well as to just have a finished product under my belt.
